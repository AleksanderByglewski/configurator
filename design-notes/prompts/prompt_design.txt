Hi chat i will need some of your help with designing my system. 
I have a set of classes located in :
controller.js
object.js 
gui.js 
implementation.js
The controller.js is responsible for setting the object to the implementation
The object controls the display of elements 
The gui is responsible for interactions with the help of graphical user interface. 

I would like you t
